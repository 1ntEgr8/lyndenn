ðŸ§¬An L-system (Lindenmayer system) animator

## What's an L-system?
To put it simply, it's a set of production rules that tell you how to expand a given set of symbols to its full form, provided you have some sort of grammar defined.

## What does the demo do?
It uses [turtle.js](https://github.com/1ntEgr8/turtlejs) to draw L-systems. Included presets include the [Gosper curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosper_curve),
the [Koch snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake), and the [Dragon curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve).
